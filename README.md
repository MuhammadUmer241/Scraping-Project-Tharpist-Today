## Setting Up the Environment
### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment


```
python -m venv venv  
```
```
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux  
```
```
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows  
```

## Install Required Dependencies

### After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Scraper
```
After setting up the environment, simply run the scrapper.py script:
```
```
Copy code
python scrapper.py
```
# Important Notes
- Duplications While Printing: While running the script, you may notice some duplication in the printed output logs. This is due to how the scraper handles repetitive pages or elements. However, the saved data in the output files will not contain any duplicates, ensuring clean and accurate results.
Make sure the virtual environment is activated before running the script to avoid dependency issues.

### **Summary**
- **Implemented:** 12 out of 28 requirements.
- **Pending:** 16 out of 28 requirements.

### **Summary of Missing Features**
- **Profile URL:** Add functionality to extract and store profile URLs.
- **Verification Status:** Extract if available.
- **Service Areas & Specialties:** Capture these fields explicitly.
- **Session Fees, Insurance Details, Payment Methods:** Add scraping logic to capture these details.
- **JSON and CSV Outputs:** Structure data into hierarchical JSON and clean CSV formats.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement a delay between requests (e.g., `time.sleep(1)`).
- **Retry Logic:** Add a retry mechanism for failed data extractions.
- 
### **Next Actions**
Focus on implementing:
1. Missing data fields (e.g., fees, specialties, and payment methods).
2. Rate limiting and retry logic.
3. Output formatting in JSON and CSV.
4. Pagination refinement to ensure comprehensive and non-redundant scraping.
